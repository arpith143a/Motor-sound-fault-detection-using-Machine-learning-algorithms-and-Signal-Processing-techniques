# Motor-sound-fault-detection-using-Machine-learning-algorithms-and-Signal-Processing-techniques

The code consists of:
1. Data preprocessing of sounds which is in wav.format using signal processing techniques
2. Feature selection using Information gain and Principal Component Analysis
3. Models training using multiple algorithms. SVM,K-Means clustering, Neural Networks, Random Forest Classifier, K Nearest Neighbors
4. Parameter selection for models using gridsearchCV and other statistical approaches
4. Model evaluation using multiple evaluation metrics
